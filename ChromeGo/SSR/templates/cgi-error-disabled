#
# Feature disabled or referrer untrusted Error Output template for Privoxy.
#
#
# USING HTML TEMPLATES:
# ---------------------
#
# Template files are written win plain HTML, with a few
# additions:
#
# - Lines that start with a '#' character like this one
#   are ignored
#
# - Each item in the below list of exported symbols will
#   be replaced by dynamically generated text, if they
#   are enclosed in '@'-characters. E.g. The string @version@
#   will be replaced by the version number of Privoxy.
#
# - One special application of this is to make whole blocks
#   of the HTML template disappear if the condition <name>
#   is not given. Simply enclose the block between the two
#   strings @if-<name>start and if-<name>-end@. The strings
#   should be placed in HTML comments (<!-- -->), so the
#   html structure won't be messed when the magic happens.
#
# USABLE SYMBOLS IN THIS TEMPLATE:

#  my-ip-addr:
#    The IP-address that the client used to reach this proxy

        <h2>Privoxy Configuration access denied</h2>
          <p>Access to <b>@url@</b> has been denied because:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>it requires a feature that has been disabled by the Privoxy administrator,</li>
            <li>you didn't come here through one of Privoxy's CGI pages, or</li>
            <li>the <q>Referer:</q> header is blocked.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note that the following features which used to be enabled in earlier
             releases are now off by default:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li><a href="@user-manual@config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a></li>
           <li><a href="@user-manual@config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE">enable-remote-toggle</a></li>
           <li><a href="@user-manual@config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE">enable-remote-http-toggle</a>
           (Most likely you don't need this anyway.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please refer to the documentation behind the links to learn how to
             enable them again and what the consequences are.</p>

          <p>All enabled features are accessible from the
             <a href="@default-cgi@">main menu</a>, some of them
             are <em>protected</em> with a referrer check though.
             If you got caught by the referrer check, but are <strong>absolutely</strong> sure
             you know what you are doing, please <a title="Retry from a trusted referrer"
              href="@url@">try again</a>.</p>

          <p>If the <q>Referer:</q> header is blocked, you'll have to make an exception for
             Privoxy's web interface first. Note that <em>dumb</em> referrer blocking
             is a bad idea anyway, as it makes it easier to fingerprint your
             requests. Consider using Privoxy's conditional referrer block instead.</p>
